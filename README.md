# VSDOpen2020_TLV_RISC-V_Tutorial

For students of the VSDOpen2020 TL-Verilog RISC-V Tutorial, by Redwood EDA.

## Slides

As you listen to videos and do the lab assignments, follow along in [the slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qpelF9nJ1VFkRIxKEfNy604nX93vkP4c/view?usp=sharing). Comments may have been added in real time to address points of confusion.

## Starting-point code

[comment]: <> (Use a link below to open the starting-point code for the CPU labs. Choose a link based on the month of your birth to help us distribute the load, and use "Open link in new tab" from the right-click pull-down menu.)

To begin the labs, right-click this <a href="https://myth2.makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fstevehoover%2FVSDOpen2020_TLV_RISC-V_Tutorial%2Fmaster%2Fstarting_point.tlv" target="_blank" atom_fix="_">Starting-point code</a> and "open link in new tab".
